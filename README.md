SolarShield
ld is a cutting-edge space weather alert and satellite protection system designed to remotely manage and safeguard satellite operations against solar storms (solar flares).
It ensures secure, authenticated control of the satellite using JWT tokens and IoT commands, visualizes potential solar flare impacts with real-time map animations, and helps activate protective shields on satellites during solar storm events.

🌍 Live Working
Users must log in securely.

Once authenticated, users can send remote commands to satellites.

If a solar flare is detected, the system visualizes the event on the map.

Protective shield mechanisms are activated remotely to safeguard satellite systems.

Security enforced via JWT Authentication and protected routes.

Solar flares are animated as expanding heat waves using Leaflet.js.
